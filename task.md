1. User Setup and First-Time Registration Flow 
All platform KPIs such as tournaments hosted, active players, tournaments 
joined, and prize pool distributed should be visible only to guest users on 
mobile. Once a user signs up or logs in on mobile, these KPIs should be 
hidden, and the screen should show only the ScrimVerse title in bold along 
with the battlefield section and tournament cards. On laptop or desktop 
views, the KPIs should always remain visible and stagnant regardless of 
whether the user is a guest or logged in. 


2. Revised Tournament Registration and Team Creation 
Flow 
Currently, when a logged-in user registers for a tournament, the system requires all players 
to already be logged into the website and manually join a team, which adds unnecessary 
friction and slows registration. What I want instead is a simplified flow where any single 
user can log into the website and initiate the tournament registration on behalf of the team. 
The user’s name should always be preset based, and during registration, they must input 
the team's name. At this stage, the user should be able to invite the remaining three 
teammates by entering their email addresses directly on the registration screen. Once the 
emails are added, the user should be able to proceed with payment, and upon successful 
payment, the team should be considered created even if the invited players have not yet 
joined. Each invited player will receive an email invite, and when they click on the invite 
link, they will be redirected to the platform where they are prompted to sign up or log in 
using Google and provide their basic details such as username or phone number. After 
logging in, they should see a clear prompt stating that they have been invited to join a 
specific team, with an option to accept or decline the invitation. If the player accepts, they 
should be automatically added to the team without any additional steps. (Please view the 
www.scrimverse.space website, register for any tournament, and you can see the flow, we 
are talking about right there.) 


3. Match, Round, and Time Visibility for Players 
Within the player dashboard, match timings should be presented in a dedicated and 
structured time section. Players should be able to see each match listed with its match 
number, group assignment, map, date, and time in a clear and readable format.(You can 
view this in the player dashboard under your registered tournaments next to the points 
table.) 

4. Host Bulk Scheduling and Auto-Sync to Player Dashboard 
On the host side, there should be a bulk scheduling system that allows hosts to schedule 
matches, and edit dates and times as required. Any changes made by the host within this 
scheduling system should automatically reflect on the player dashboard in real time. (you 
can view this in the host dashboard, manage tournament, and you can view it in the top 
itself named bulk) 


5. Tournament Management Page  
The tournament management page should closely match the overall look and structure of 
scrimverse.space. While it does not need to be an exact copy, the layout, styling, and user 
experience should feel consistent with the main website so that hosts experience a 
seamless and familiar interface when managing tournaments.(The current host 
management portal can be accessed from the host dashboard by clicking Manage, then 
Start Round One, Confirm, and Start, which opens the full host management UI in 
scrimverse.space) 


6. Tournament Details Page Restructuring for Players 
The tournament details page visible to players should be given dropdowns to present 
information in a clear and structured manner rather than long, scroll-heavy sections. Prize 
pool details, rounds, timelines, briefing, rules, host information, entry fee, and streaming 
details should all be displayed in well-defined sections that are easy to scan and 
understand. 
Prize Pool and Points System Configuration (Host Side) 
While creating a tournament, the host should be required to define the prize pool and the 
points system during the creation flow itself. This includes entering the total prize pool, 
configuring prize distribution for different placements, and setting placement points for 
positions such as first, second, third, and beyond. These values should be fully editable, 
feasible to change at any time, All configured prize pool and points data must be 
accurately reflected on the tournament view details page for players to see. (You can view 
this in Host Dashboard → Create Tournament → Scroll Down) 
Loading Screen, Landing Page, and Phase-One UI Quality 
The loading screen UI should follow the same visual style and branding as the 
Scrimverse.space website to maintain consistency and brand recall. The landing page 
needs to be polished, as many players will enter the platform initially, and the first 
impression is critical. For phase one, priority should be given landing page and a well
designed host management page so that both players and hosts immediately experience a 
professional, reliable, and scalable platform from their first interaction. 
And a close remix of the lovable website. How much ever is feasible, Within the time.
